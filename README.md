# ðŸ“š Research Works

This repository showcases a collection of academic and technical research projects I've completed, focused on key areas in computer networking, cybersecurity, AI, and IoT systems. Each folder includes detailed documentation of the work, analysis, and insights gained from in-depth study.

## Topics Covered:

- **Generative AI Security and Privacy**  
  Review of attack vectors, ethical concerns, and mitigation strategies for large AI models.

- **Modern Cryptographic Techniques**  
  Comparative analysis of ECC, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, with focus on TLS, password security, and IoT resilience.

- **Ontology-Based Access Control (OBAC) in Industrial Vehicle**  
  Study on context-aware access models for autonomous vehicles, with ML-based optimizations.

- **IoT-Based Accident Detection System**  
  Research on real-time crash detection and emergency alert systems to improve road safety and emergency response times.

Each research topic is documented in its respective PDFs with summaries. These works were completed as part of my academic coursework during both undergraduate and postgraduate studies, including my final year project.

Feel free to explore the documents for detailed insights.
